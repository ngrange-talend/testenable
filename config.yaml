params:
# The "api-list" parameter configures the way APIs are displayed in the list of APIs page ("/apis/").
# By default APIs are sorted according to their names.
# But it can be configured to gather them by topic.
# Here is a sample configuration that creates a group entitled "Core APIs" which gathers the APIs
# "contacts" and "tasks". These names are the names of sub-directories of "/apis".
# Other APIs should be in the default group or they won't be displayed.

#  api-list:
#    - Core APIs:
#      - contacts
#      - tasks
#    - default:
#      - petstore
